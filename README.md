# Interactive-Dashboard


This is an assignment to create an dashboard. 


Welcome to the Dashboard Layout project! This dashboard layout is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for data visualization and interaction.

## Features

- **Dark and Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light themes for better user experience in different lighting conditions.
- **WebGL Shaders Waves**: Interactive waves powered by WebGL shaders respond to mouse movement, adding a dynamic element to the dashboard.
- **File Architecture**: Clear file architecture distinguishes between components and pages, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
